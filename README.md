# Assistive_Vision_Image_Caption_Generator

The computer vision based assistive technology for the blind and visually impaired is a developing area. The assistive technology helps the visually impaired by providing them with a greater independence. By enabling them with their day-to-day activities like indoor and outdoor navigation, obstacle detection, locating the doors and lost objects, etc. Even though different assistive technologies are available for the blind, most of them have complex designs which are developed for a specific purpose and are expensive for the commercial production.

Here we build a basic Assistive Vision Model using Image Caption Generator and then integrating it with text to speech API and voice command .
